# EcoBoost

An environmental learning game that helps young kids age 12 and younger learn what they can do to help the environment. 
Learning will consist of minigames, a certificate that lets parents know their kids have completed the game, and a donation page 
that allows users to donate to a charity directly impacting the environment. The website will encourage kids to form or join 
clubs at school that promote a clean environment and hopefully make them more aware of what is happening around them.
